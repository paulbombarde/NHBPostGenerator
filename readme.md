# NHB Post Generator

Lazy work to generate Instagram post images for Nyon Handball La CÃ´te out of the [official ics calendar retrieved from the FSH website](https://www.handball.ch/fr/matchcenter/vereine/330442#/schedule).

## Setup

* Requires a recent `python` (and `pip`) version. Developed with `3.12`.
* To avoid the pain of installing `cairo` this tool need [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org) to generate the png out of the svg. It was developed with `1.3.2`.
* If you did not install Inkscape in the classic place, update its path at the beginning of the script (TODO: config file).

Then run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To be completed

## Templates

Templates are expected to be svg edited by Inkscape and exported as `Inkscape SVG`. Texts (and logos) to be replaced are expected to be tagged as `inkscape:label`.

## Logic

1. Parses the ics input file, group matches by dates.
2. Group matches H1 / D3 / Rest
3. Open the corresponding templates, searches for specific `inkscape:label` value.
   1. In each of those, get the underlying `svg:span` and replace the associated text.
   2. Some replacements occur for well known places, clubs...
   3. Clubs logos are retrieved from the repo assets. The logos provided by the FSH are very bad quality.
